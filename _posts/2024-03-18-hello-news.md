Hey everyone!

Just wanted to give you a quick update on some new features I've added to the website. First up, we now have a news section to keep you informed about the latest happenings. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ˜Š

I've also implemented a new comments system, allowing you to engage with content in a more interactive way, this includes images and GIFs! It also looks about a thousand times better compared to the old system, so that's a nice bonus.

Additionally, the homepage has been refreshed with a new look and feel. Go and check it out! Although that's probably how you got here in the first place...

Lastly, I've launched a new newsletter to keep you in the loop with news. [Subscribe]({{ site.baseurl }}/#newsletter) to stay connected with our little community.

Thanks for your support, and I look forward to sharing more news soon! ðŸ˜‰
