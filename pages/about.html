      <span>Hey there! My name is Hielke, I'm a Minecraft content creator.<br>Here's all you need to know about
        me!<br><br>
        <h5>The Beginning</h5>
        My journey started back in 2013, when I first discovered a block in Minecraft called the command block. I wanted
        to create something cool with it, so I created a simple TNT PvP map, called
        <a href="https://www.minecraftmaps.com/pvp-maps/bomb-battle" target="_blank">Bomb Battle</a>.
      </span>
      <figure class="figure">
        <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/about/bomb_battle.jpg">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">I know it's not the prettiest map, alright? &#128521;</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <span>
        First I only played the map with my friends, but then they suggested to post the map online and let other people
        enjoy it too. That's how I got into mapmaking.<br>
      </span>
      <p>
        <h5>The Parkour</h5>
        After I posted a few minigame maps, I wanted to create something else. I've always enjoyed playing parkour maps
        in
        Minecraft, so my idea was to create one myself. I created a map with 100 different rooms, came up with a catchy
        name (Parkour Paradise), and posted it online.
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/about/parkour_paradise_old.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">The original Parkour Paradise map.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        To my surprise, the map blew up, and now Parkour Paradise has over 300.000 downloads! That's when I knew I
        had talent for map making, specifically parkour maps.<br>
        Over the years I've created several parkour maps, like <a target=”_blank” href="{{site.baseurl}}/maps/parkour-spiral" style="color: #007bff;text-decoration: underline;">Parkour Spiral</a>, <a target=”_blank” href="/maps/parkour-pyramid" style="color: #007bff;text-decoration: underline;">Parkour Pyramid</a> and <a target=”_blank” href="/maps/dimension-parkour" style="color: #007bff;text-decoration: underline;">Dimension Parkour</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>The Marketplace</h5>
        Since late 2019 I am an official Minecraft Partner! This means I can offer my maps on the Minecraft
        Marketplace, and thus opening my audience up to so many new people!<br>
        I have updated and improved all my older maps, making them more up to date and adding even more content to them!<br>

          <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="{{site.baseurl}}/media/about/parkour_paradise.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">The updated Parkour Paradise map. Can you spot all the 6321 changes?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <h5>The Future</h5>
        Right now I am working on more maps, and I can't wait to show them to you when it's time!<br>
        I will always try and release my maps for both the Java and the Bedrock edition of Minecraft, so no matter where you play, you can enjoy my creations! 😃<br>
        <br>
